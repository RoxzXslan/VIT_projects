This Project is focused on making, a Basic Line Follower Robot Algorithm using Intel 8086.

The codes for Assembly Language and Arduino are provided.

The .asm code is ran in emu8086 and verfied for output.

The .asm code, has loops to fetch the line's orientation with sensor and provides feedback as a string to control the motors, as we didnt include IN and OUT ports in this project, also this program uses user's input to fetch the desired output.
